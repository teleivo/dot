# DOT

Parser for the [DOT language](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) written in Go.

## Install

```sh
go get -u github.com/teleivo/dot
```

**Needs: export GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc** as it uses the experimental [iterators](https://go.dev/wiki/RangefuncExperiment).

## Disclaimer

I wrote this library for my personal projects. It is thus tailored to my needs. Feel free to use it!
That being said, my intention is not to adjust it to someone elses liking.
